# Nvim config
## Info
This branch includes a slimmer newer neovim config. This has lsp configured again from scratch. Some things are added compared to the old branch and some things have been discarded. The old config will still be available.
> [!info]
> C lsp might not work on windows especially. There is a fix for this in the old config but since i don't code in c anymore there is no need to copy the fix right now. Might do later.
